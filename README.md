# Data Structures In C

Built from scratch using basic C contructs, this project showcases how to implement multiple data structures in the C programming language, and is intermediately heavy on pointers.

Although the repo comes with the object files pre-built and also the executable binary files, instructions on how to compile and run each program are in the readme files of each folder representing each data structure.

The data-type of the data that can be stored in each data structure for now are integers only. Strings are a bit complicated and will be added later, as the project progresses.
