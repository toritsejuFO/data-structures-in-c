# The stack data structure
Stacks are implemented with linked nodes underneath the hood, much like linked_list, major difference is the LIFO principle of stack i.e where push(insert) and pop(delete) operations can only happen at tyhe top of the stack.

## How to compile
* Inside the root project directory
* Run `cd stack/src`
* Run `make`

## How to run
* Run `./main`

## Clean up
* Run `make clean` to remove previously built object files

Edit *Makefile* to change name of executable or compilation process and re-run
