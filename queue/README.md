# The queue data structure
Queues are implemented with linked nodes underneath the hood, much like linked_list, major difference is the First In First Out (FIFO) principle of queues i.e where enqueue(insert) and dequeue(delete) operations can only happen at the end and beginning of the queue respectively.

## How to compile
* Inside the root project directory
* Run `cd queue/src`
* Run `make`

## How to run
* Run `./main`

## Clean up
* Run `make clean` to remove previously built object files

Edit **_Makefile_** to change name of executable or compilation process and re-run
